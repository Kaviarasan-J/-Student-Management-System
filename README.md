# 🎓 Student Management System

This **Student Management System** project is a desktop application built using **Python** and **SQLite** for managing student records. The application allows you to add, update, delete, and display student information, including their ID, name, age, date of birth, gender, and city. It features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with **Tkinter**, making it easy to manage student data effectively.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the application.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **SQLite**: For storing and managing student data.

## ✨ Features
- **Add Students**: Add new student records with ID, name, age, DOB, gender, and city.
- **Update Records**: Modify existing student information.
- **Delete Students**: Remove a student's record from the database.
- **View Records**: Display all student data in a structured table format.
- **Clear Inputs**: Easily clear the input fields after operations.

## 🚀 Demo
Download the project and run it locally to manage your student records.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`main.py`**: The main Python file that contains the logic for the application, including the GUI interface and database operations.
- **`student.db`**: The SQLite database file where all student information is stored.

## 💡 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-system.git
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed. Install necessary packages (Tkinter and SQLite come pre-installed with Python).
   
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### 🖥️ User Interface Overview
- **Student Details Form**: Input fields for entering student details (ID, Name, Age, DOB, Gender, City).
- **Action Buttons**: Buttons to add, delete, update, and clear student data.
- **Data Table**: Displays all stored student records in a table format.

## 🧩 Code Overview
- **`main.py`**: Contains the following:
  - **Tkinter GUI**: Provides the interface for user interactions.
  - **SQLite Operations**: Handles database operations like adding, deleting, and updating student records.
  - **Treeview Widget**: Displays student data in a tabular format.
  
## Sample Functions:
- **Add Student**:
   ```python
   def Add(self):
       # Code for adding a new student record
   ```
- **Update Student**:
   ```python
   def Update(self):
       # Code for updating an existing student record
   ```
- **Delete Student**:
   ```python
   def Delete(self):
       # Code for deleting a student record
   ```

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
By developing this project, I improved my understanding of:
- **GUI design** with **Tkinter**.
- Working with **SQLite** databases to store and manage records.
- Handling **CRUD operations** programmatically.
- Structuring and organizing desktop applications in Python.

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add **search functionality** to find students by ID or name.
- [ ] Implement **data export** feature (CSV or Excel).
- [ ] Integrate **user authentication** to restrict access to the system.
